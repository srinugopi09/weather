Here's a comprehensive summary of the two applications we've built, which you can use as context for your next chat:

# MCP Chat Application - Summary

## Python Backend (`mcp_chat_cli.py`)

### Core Components:
1. **MCPToolProvider**: Manages connections to MCP servers
   - Loads server configurations from JSON file
   - Connects to servers via stdio transport
   - Discovers and executes tools from MCP servers

2. **LLMProvider**: Pluggable LLM integration with support for:
   - Anthropic API (direct)
   - AWS Bedrock (using Claude models)
   - Extensible design for adding more providers

3. **ChatApplication**: Main application logic
   - Manages conversation history
   - Processes user queries using LLMs and MCP tools
   - Handles tool execution and responses

4. **Command-line Interface**:
   - Regular interactive mode
   - JSON mode for integration with React CLI

### Key Features:
- Provider selection (Anthropic/Bedrock)
- MCP server connection management
- Tool discovery and execution
- Conversation handling

## React Ink CLI (`src/cli.tsx`)

### Core Components:
1. **ChatApp Component**: Main UI interface
   - Provider selection screen
   - Chat history display
   - Input handling
   - Connection status reporting

2. **Python Process Management**:
   - Spawns the Python backend with appropriate parameters
   - Communicates via stdio
   - Handles process lifecycle

3. **Message Handling**:
   - Parses JSON responses from Python
   - Displays assistant responses
   - Shows loading indicators
   - Reports errors

### Key Features:
- Beautiful terminal UI with React Ink
- Provider switching (Anthropic/Bedrock)
- Connection status display
- Chat history visualization
- Error reporting and handling

## Configuration:
- `mcp_config.json`: Defines MCP servers
- Command-line arguments for provider selection
- Environment variables for API keys

## Current State:
- Both Python backend and React CLI are functioning
- Integration between them is working
- AWS Bedrock integration requires correct model ID configuration
- Proper error handling implemented

## Next Steps:
1. Fine-tune AWS Bedrock integration
2. Add more LLM providers
3. Enhance UI with more features
4. Implement conversation history persistence

This summary should provide sufficient context for continuing development in your next chat session.
